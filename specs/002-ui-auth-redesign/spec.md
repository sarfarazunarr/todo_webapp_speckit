# Feature Specification: Premium UI and BetterAuth Integration

**Feature Branch**: `002-ui-auth-redesign`  
**Created**: 2026-01-08
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Keep all the things as it they are just update the @frontend UI design to amazing premium level ui design and give it proper UI imporvement and loaders. And BetterAuth is not implemented transfrom current authentication strategy with betterauth authetication. And also update codebase on @frontend as well as on @backend for handling tokens created using betterauth. For more help regarding betterauth use context7."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Modern UI Experience (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want a modern, visually appealing, and intuitive interface so that my experience is enjoyable and I can navigate the application with ease.

**Why this priority**: A high-quality user interface is crucial for user engagement and satisfaction. It directly impacts the perceived value and professionalism of the application.

**Independent Test**: The new UI can be deployed and evaluated independently of the authentication changes. Users can be asked to perform standard tasks and provide feedback on the new design.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user opens the application, **When** they view any page, **Then** all visual elements (buttons, forms, text, layout) should appear polished, modern, and consistent.
2. **Given** a user is waiting for data to load, **When** an API call is in progress, **Then** a loading indicator (e.g., a spinner or skeleton screen) is displayed to provide feedback.

### User Story 2 - Secure and Seamless Authentication (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to securely log in to the application using a new, improved authentication system (BetterAuth) so that my account is protected and I can access my data.

**Why this priority**: Secure authentication is a fundamental requirement for any application that handles user data. Migrating to a new system is a critical task.

**Independent Test**: The authentication flow can be tested by attempting to sign up, log in, and access protected resources.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new user wants to register, **When** they provide their credentials, **Then** a new account is created in the BetterAuth system.
2. **Given** an existing user wants to log in, **When** they enter their credentials, **Then** they are successfully authenticated and receive an access token.
3. **Given** a logged-in user, **When** they try to access a protected page or API endpoint, **Then** the system validates their token and grants access.
4. **Given** a user with an invalid or expired token, **When** they try to access a protected resource, **Then** they are denied access and prompted to log in again.


## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The frontend user interface MUST be completely redesigned to a premium, modern aesthetic.
- **FR-002**: The application MUST use "BetterAuth" as the sole method for user authentication and authorization.
- **FR-003**: The backend API MUST be updated to validate access tokens generated by BetterAuth.
- **FR-004**: The frontend application MUST be updated to handle the full BetterAuth authentication lifecycle (signup, login, logout, token management).
- **FR-005**: The UI MUST include user-friendly loading indicators (e.g., spinners, skeleton loaders) during asynchronous operations.
- **FR-006**: The existing user authentication system MUST be completely removed and replaced.
- **FR-007**: System MUST authenticate users via Simple Username and password login
- **FR-008**: The frontend UI MUST follow Utilize a specific UI library (e.g., Shadcn, Chakra UI, Ant Design)

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 100% of users successfully authenticate through the new BetterAuth system.
- **SC-002**: All API endpoints requiring authentication are protected and return a 401/403 error for invalid tokens.
- **SC-003**: Page load times for all major pages should not increase by more than 15% after the UI redesign.
- **SC-004**: Animations and transitions should be "smooth enough" without a specific FPS target
