## Question 1: BetterAuth Authentication Flow

**Context**: In Functional Requirement FR-007, we need to understand the specifics of the BetterAuth authentication flow.

**What we need to know**: What is the exact authentication flow for BetterAuth? (e.g., social login, passwordless, MFA)

**Suggested Answers**:

| Option | Answer | Implications |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| A      | Standard username/password login with email verification | Simpler initial implementation, common pattern. |
| B      | Social logins (e.g., Google, GitHub) | Broader user base, relies on external providers. |
| C      | Passwordless authentication (e.g., magic links, WebAuthn) | Enhanced security, modern user experience. |
| D      | Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) | Increased security, adds complexity to flow. |
| Custom | Provide your own answer | Specify any combination or alternative flow. |

**Your choice**: A (Simple Username and password login)

## Question 2: UI Branding Guidelines/Design Mockups

**Context**: Functional Requirement FR-008 states that the frontend UI must follow specific branding guidelines or design mockups for the 'premium level UI'.

**What we need to know**: What are the specific branding guidelines or design mockups for the 'premium level UI'?

**Suggested Answers**:

| Option | Answer | Implications |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| A      | Adhere to Material Design principles | Well-documented design system, common patterns. |
| B      | Follow specific provided design mockups/Figma files | Requires external design assets, ensures exact visual match. |
| C      | Utilize a specific UI library (e.g., Shadcn, Chakra UI, Ant Design) | Faster development, consistent components, less custom styling. |
| D      | Based on a general "modern and clean" aesthetic | More room for developer interpretation, potential for inconsistencies. |
| Custom | Provide your own answer | Specify any other design system, framework, or guidelines. |

**Your choice**: C (Utilize a specific UI library (e.g., Shadcn, Chakra UI, Ant Design))

## Question 3: UI Performance Requirements

**Context**: Success Criterion SC-004 asks about specific performance requirements for the new UI, such as animation smoothness.

**What we need to know**: Are there specific performance requirements for the new UI, such as animation smoothness (e.g., 60fps)?

**Suggested Answers**:

| Option | Answer | Implications |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| A      | All animations and transitions should aim for 60 frames per second (fps) | High-quality user experience, potential for increased development effort. |
| B      | Animations and transitions should be "smooth enough" without a specific FPS target | More flexibility for developers, relies on subjective judgment. |
| C      | No specific animation performance requirements beyond general responsiveness | Minimal overhead for animations, focus on core functionality. |
| Custom | Provide your own answer | Specify any other animation or UI performance targets. |

**Your choice**: B
